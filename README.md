## Data Structures Programming Assignment 04: Binary Search Trees
### Problems
Practice implementing binary search trees including balanced ones and using them to solve algorithmic problems:
* [`/src/tree_orders/tree_orders.java`](src/tree_orders/tree_orders.java): Problem 1, Binary tree traversals, implements in-order, pre-order and post-order traversals of a binary tree (PASSED);
* [`/src/set_range_sum/SetRangeSum.java`](src/set_range_sum/SetRangeSum.java): Problem 2, Set with range sums, implements a data structure to store a set of integers and quickly compute range sums;
* [`/src/rope/RopeProblem.java`](src/rope/RopeProblem.java): Advanced Problem 3, Rope, implements Rope â€” data structure that can store a string and efficiently cut a part (a substring) of this string and insert it in a different position.
